It’s already 12 years since  John Terry slipped and missed a game-winning penalty that was supposed to give Chelsea it’s first Champions League medal. Terry had the chance to provide Chelsea with an iconic Champions League final victory in Moscow, but the wet surface meant that he miscued his shot and the ball struck the post in one of the most infamous moments in European football history. In an interview with FourFourTwo, Van Der Sar reminisces how he studied around 40 of Frank Lampard’s penalties before the game. Follow Football Livescore Today He explained in an edition of FourFourTwo:“I remember studying a lot of Chelsea’s penalties on DVD before the match. So, for example, I think I probably analysed about 40 that Frank Lampard had taken in the past. I had made plenty of notes and noticed that Nicolas Anelka would almost always take his penalties to the goalkeeper’s right.” ‘I analysed about 40 that Frank Lampard had taken. I made plenty of notes and noticed Anelka would almost always take his to the keeper’s right.’ ‘Later on, I heard that Chelsea had also done their homework on me and learned that I usually dived to my right. So I think their players were told to shoot to my left, which most of them did [they all did, bar Anelka]. I’d anticipated Anelka would shoot to the other side, and thankfully that is what happened.’ He continued:‘After I had pushed away Anelka’s penalty, I feel like I was separated from the world for a couple of seconds.’ I don’t think I’ll ever experience a more ecstatic moment than when I realised we’d just won the Champions League final and noticed all my team-mates running towards me. It was the highlight of my whole career.’ Can you remember the moment?
